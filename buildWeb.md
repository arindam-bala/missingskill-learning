> ### **Programming Languages**
---
[Contents](#Contents)

Programming Languages are the base of computer softwares. There are many programming languages 
in the world today. The evaluation of these languages are from late 1960s. All these languages are build on codes. Codes that a normal human can't understand. To understand this we have to study the language. Softwares are built using programming languages by implementing algorithms. 

> ### There are three different levels of programming languages.
---
[Contents](#Contents)

* Low Level Language
    
    * Examples : Assembly Language, Rust 
* Middle Level Language
    * Examples : C, C++
* High Level Language
    * Examples : Java, Python

> ### **IP Adresses**
---
[Contents](#Contents)

IP address means internet protocol address. It is the address of an Internet Connection or a network. There are two types of IP address.

1. IPv4 : It is 32 bit Internet Protocol Addressing system. All these 32 bits are divided into four 8 bit divisions.

1. Binary Example
    

    | 8 bits     | 8bits      | 8 bits    | 8 bits    |
    | -----------| -----------| ----------|-----------|         
    |  00000001  | 00001011   | 00000011  | 00011111  | 

1. This IP address in dotted decimal is
    128.11.3.31
1. In Hexadecimal it is 80 0B 03 1F

1. In this protocol approx 4 billion address space are available.

### **Classes**
---
| Class    | Prefixes     | First Byte | 
|----------|----------    |------------|
|A         |n = 8 bits    |   0 to 127 |
|B         |n = 16 bits   | 128 to 191 |
|C         |n = 24 bits   | 192 to 223 |
|D         |not applicable| 224 to 239 |
|E         |not applicable| 240 to 255 |

---
**IPv6** :
    
* It is a 128 bit internet protocol address system.

* It is also known as next generation IP.

* Represented in Hexadecimal number system.
* Address space is about 2^128

---

> ## **Port**
---
[Contents](#Contents)

* A port is a virtual point where network connections start aSoftware Licensesnd ends.

* Ports are software based and managed by computer's Operating System.

* Each port assigned a number.

* Most ports are reserved for certain protocols

* (HTTP) Hyper Text Transfer Protocol goed to port 80

---

> ### **Domain**
---
[Contents](#Contents)

* A Domain refers to any group of users, workstations,database servers that share different types of data via network resources.

---
> ### **Browsers**
---
[Contents](#Contents)

Browsers are application programs that runs in a computer system via its Operating System and connects the computer to the internet to surfing different websites.

* Examples:

    1. Internet Explorer
    1. Mozilla Firefox
    1. Microsoft Edge
    1. Opera Mini

---
> ### **Code Editor**
---
[Contents](#Contents)

Code editors are application programs that runs on pc and helps programmers to write efficient codes without any syntactical error.

* Examples:

    1. Sublime Text Editor
    1. Visual Studio Code
    1. Code Blocks
    1. Atom
---   

> ### **HTTP, HTTPS** : 

* **HTTP** : This is stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. This is data transfering protocol. Through this protocol data can be transmitted and received by a system from a server.

* **HTTPS**: This is also the same sa HTTP but with a secure socket layer (SSL). Data send and received through this protocol is encrypted by this secure socket layer.

> ### **Web Server** : 
---
1. Digital Ocean
1. Vultr
1. Linode
1. Heruko
---

> ### **API and Endpoints** : 

1.API stands for application programming interface. That permits the interaction between two systems.

1.API endpoint is a point of entry in a communication channel when two system are interacting with each other through API.
